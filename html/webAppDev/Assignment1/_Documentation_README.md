# PROJECT - Documentation/Reflection

#### REFLECTION:
**Planning:** 
Firstly a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was developed that outlined the database structure. This ERD not only served as a visual guide but also helped identify potential pitfalls and design a database schema that could effectively support the application requirements.

**Problem Solving:** 
Methodical problem-solving approach was utilised. Upon encountering issues, error messages and examined logs were reviewed to pinpoint root causes. Laravel's comprehensive documentation proved instrumental in resolving these hurdles.

**Reflection:** 
Throughout the development process, I consistently reflected on progress. Initial planning was revisitied to ensure alignment with the project's direction. Challenges were noted and priorisitised accordingly. This iterative reflection empowered me to adapt and evolve as the project unfolded.

**Future Improvements:** 
Looking ahead to Assignment 2, several areas have been acknowledged for improvement. Expanded testing coverage,the aim to optimize the codebase through comprehensive code reviews and refactoring, documentation efforts will also intensify, encompassing inline comments for complex sections of code and comprehensive README documentation to facilitate future development. Security measures will be fortified to ensure user data and the application remain secure.

In essence, the development process for Assignment 1 was characterized by a well-balanced blend of planning, testing, problem-solving, and reflection. These practices not only facilitated the completion of the assignment but also paved the way for a robust and adaptable foundation for Assignment 2.

## Conclusion
Assignment 1 has provided a strong foundation for web application development using the Laravel framework. The tasks completed reflect a thorough understanding of database design, user interface development, and security measures. The development process involved careful planning, frequent testing, organized version control, and effective problem-solving.

The proposed changes for Assignment 2 aim to enhance the development process further by focusing on unique user listing, implementing likes functionality, improving the user interface, optimizing the code, thorough documentation, comprehensive testing, and strengthening security measures.

These improvements will contribute to the continued success of the project and result in a high-quality web application for Assignment 2.
