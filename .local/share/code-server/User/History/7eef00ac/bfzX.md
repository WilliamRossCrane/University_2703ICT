# Project Security Measures

## HTML and SQL Sanitization
HTML and SQL sanitization are security measures to protect against various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. These measures are implemented in the following parts of the project:

### HTML Sanitization
HTML sanitization is applied to user-generated content before rendering it in views. This prevents any malicious code or scripts from being executed in the user's browser. It is implemented in the following locations:
- **View Templates**: Laravel's built-in escaping functions (`{!! !!}`) are used to render user-generated content safely. This ensures that any HTML tags or JavaScript code in user inputs are displayed as plain text.

### SQL Sanitization
SQL sanitization is applied to user inputs before they are used in database queries. This prevents SQL Injection attacks, which can manipulate or extract data from the database. It is implemented in the following locations:
- **Eloquent Queries**: Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which automatically escapes and sanitizes input data in database queries. This protects the application from SQL Injection.

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection
CSRF protection is essential to prevent attackers from tricking users into making unintended actions on our website without their consent. CSRF protection is implemented in the following way:
- **Laravel Middleware**: Laravel provides built-in CSRF protection through middleware. This middleware generates a unique token for each user session and ensures that each POST, PUT, or DELETE request includes this token. This way, the application can verify the authenticity of requests and protect against CSRF attacks.

## Additional Security Measures
In addition to the above measures, other security practices implemented, include:
- **Secure Dependencies**: We regularly update our project dependencies, including Laravel and other packages, to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS**: Our application is configured to use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.

By implementing these security measures, a secure and reliable experience is provided for users while protecting the application from common web security threats.
