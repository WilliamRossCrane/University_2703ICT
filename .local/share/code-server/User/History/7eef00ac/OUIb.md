# Project Security Measures

In this section, we'll outline the security measures implemented in our project to ensure the safety and integrity of our application.

## HTML and SQL Sanitization

HTML and SQL sanitization are crucial security measures to protect against various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. These measures are implemented in the following parts of our project:

### HTML Sanitization

HTML sanitization is applied to user-generated content before rendering it in views. This prevents any malicious code or scripts from being executed in the user's browser. It is implemented in the following locations:

- **View Templates**: We use Laravel's built-in escaping functions (`{!! !!}`) to render user-generated content safely. This ensures that any HTML tags or JavaScript code in user inputs are displayed as plain text.

### SQL Sanitization

SQL sanitization is applied to user inputs before they are used in database queries. This prevents SQL Injection attacks, which can manipulate or extract data from the database. It is implemented in the following locations:

- **Eloquent Queries**: We use Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which automatically escapes and sanitizes input data in database queries. This protects our application from SQL Injection.

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection

CSRF protection is essential to prevent attackers from tricking users into making unintended actions on our website without their consent. We implement CSRF protection in the following way:

- **Laravel Middleware**: Laravel provides built-in CSRF protection through middleware. This middleware generates a unique token for each user session and ensures that each POST, PUT, or DELETE request includes this token. This way, our application can verify the authenticity of requests and protect against CSRF attacks.

## Additional Security Measures

In addition to the above measures, we also implement other security best practices, including:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: We use Laravel's built-in authentication system, which includes secure password hashing and role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

- **Secure Dependencies**: We regularly update our project dependencies, including Laravel and other packages, to patch known security vulnerabilities.

- **HTTPS**: Our application is configured to use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.

By implementing these security measures, we aim to provide a secure and reliable experience for our users while protecting our application from common web security threats.

Remember to mention the specific locations where these security measures are implemented in your project, such as view templates, middleware, or Eloquent queries. This will help your lecturers understand how you've applied these measures in practice.
